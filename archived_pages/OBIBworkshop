# 2014 ICBO Workshop: Starting an OBI-based Biobank Ontology
<p><strong>Venue</p></strong>
	<dl><dd>This workshop is collocated with the <a href="http://icbo14.com/" title="2014 ICBO conference" target="_blank">2014 ICBO conference</a> taking place in Houston, TX, USA</dl></dd>

<p><strong>Objective and Scope</p></strong>
	<dl><dd>Biobanks are a critical resource for translational science. However, they often suffer from a lack of semantics in their ability to disseminate data and make it readily queryable. The OBO Foundry provides ontologies that are relevant to representing the structure and function of biobanks. Currently the OBO Foundry doesn't address many aspects of biobanks necessary for best utilization of their data. The organizers of this workshop have independently developed biobank ontologies [<a href="#refs1">1-5</a>] based on the Ontology of Biomedical Investigations (OBI) [<a href="#refs6">6</a>] and view this workshop as an opportunity to expand our collaboration with other ontologists interested in biobanks. We also wish to bring together people from the biobank world who are interested in bringing ontologies into this effort. The workshop will focus on problems and requirements of a biobank ontology, as well as potential solutions.

	<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
    	<ul><li>Information models describing biobanks, their strengths, weaknesses, and competency criteria</li>
    		<li>Reports of biobank related ontologies</li>
    		<li>Case studies of applying ontologies to biobanks</li></ul>

	<p>All attendees will be expected to be interested in building an OBO Foundry compliant biobank ontology or providing use cases for a biobank ontology.</p>

<p><em>Presentations (1.5 h)</em></p>
	<dl><dd>8:30 AM -9:00 AM: Keynote - Dave Parrish "The Bio-Specimen Knowledge Bank - Enriching the specimen repository through ontology driven annotation and curation"</dd>
Dave Parrish is the Senior Director for Laboratory Informatics at Data in Motion and key driver of the sampleminded product strategy.  He is currently fully engaged at the NIAID Integrated Research Facility (IRF) in Frederick Maryland establishing a unified  research operation management system (ROMS).  The IRF ROMS is a collection of commercial information management systems integrated through shared models of research data and the IRF operational workflows.  The ROMS supports the complete study lifecycle from study design and review through study execution and data archive

Mr. Parrish has more than 20 years of experience developing knowledge-based solutions at the intersection of clinical research and data management. His expertise has evolved around three specific dimension of informatics: (1) Data Management and Data Warehousing, (2) Clinical Vocabularies and Controlled Terminologies, and (3) Development of Clinical Trials Ontologies, each focused on applying a pragmatic solution to clinical research. Over his career he has been at the forefront of adopting leading-edge information systems in support of clinical research. Mr. Parrish has supported a broad range information management activities—from software product development to clinical trials data center operations—that required skills to effectively involve users in the planning and implementation of client-directed, problem-oriented solutions.</dd></dl>
