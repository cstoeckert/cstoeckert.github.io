# Significance Testing for Aberrant Copy-Number (STAC)
The Problem:
- Genomic copy number aberrations (CNAs) occur in many solid tumors and may drive tumor initiation and/or progression.
- The problem is to determine CNAs which occur significantloy more often than chance across multiple samples in a class of tumors.
- Accurate identification of such significant CNAs across multiple experiments/samples is necessary for prioritizing regions for further study.
- Researchers have traditionally relied on non-statistical methods such as simple frequency cutoffs and manual review to prioritize regions.
- This approach may identify some regions of interest, however, it is subject to investigator bias and lacks statistical power necessary to control the error rates involved.
- Therefore there is a need for unbiased statistical methods which can identify non-random genomic copy number changes from multiple experiments. 

We developed STAC to fill this need.
