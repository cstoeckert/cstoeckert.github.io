# AnnotCompute
AnnotCompute was a tool to identify similar functional genomics experiments (mainly microarray experiments) based on standardized annotations containing the MGED Ontology (MO) terms. Users could search for experiments using keywords or based on annotations similarity to an experiment they provided in MAGE-TAB format. The searches were carried out against a collection of 34391 experiments downloaded from ArrayExpress in January 2013.
