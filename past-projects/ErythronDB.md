# ErythronDB
The Erythron Database (ErythronDB) was a resource dedicated to facilitating better understanding of the cellular and molecular underpinnings of mammalian erythropoiesis. It provided a searchable database of murine gene expression during murine primitive, definitive, and stress erythroid cells at progressive stages of maturation. ErythronDB also allowed users to explore the role of erythropoietin (the principal hormone regulating erythropoiesis) and identify potential targets of EPO-signaling via comparison of rhEPO-treated versus control cells in mouse (microarray expression) and human (proteomics) datasets.

ErythronDB was developed by a team of researchers at the University of Pennsylvania. Code for generating the web site is available at https://github.com/ErythronDB/erythrondb-docker
