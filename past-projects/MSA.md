# CGH-Multiple Sample Analysis (CGH-MSA)
## What MSA does:
- Analysis of microarray based copy number data for the determination of chromosomal aberrations.
- Identification of concordant aberration across multiple samples. Uses multiple experiment as replication to identify important chromosomal regions.

## Publication:
Assessing the significance of conserved genomic aberrations using high resolution genomic microarrays.
