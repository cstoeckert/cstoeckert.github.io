  Welcome to the Computational Biology and Informatics Laboratory (CBIL) in the Institute for Biomedical Informatics. The goal of our work was to help make sense of the enormous amount of biomedical data generated by high-throughput genomic approaches and synthesize them into something more than the sum of the parts. To that end, we developed tools that enable researchers to mine and integrate data from a variety of different sources and types of experiments. In particular we applyied these approaches to expand our understanding of various diseases such as those caused by eukaryotic pathogens. We modeled data with networks and reality with ontologies especially the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) for the latter.

CBIL was directed by Chris Stoeckert who is faculty in the Department of Genetics in the Perelman School of Medicine.
