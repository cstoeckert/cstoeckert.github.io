  Welcome to the Computational Biology and Informatics Laboratory (CBIL) in the Institute for Biomedical Informatics. The goal of our work is to help make sense of the enormous amount of biomedical data generated by high-throughput genomic approaches and synthesize them into something more than the sum of the parts. To that end, we are developing tools that enable researchers to mine and integrate data from a variety of different sources and types of experiments. In particular we are applying these approaches to expand our understanding in the areas of diabetes and infectious disease. We model data with networks and reality with ontologies especially the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) for the latter.
